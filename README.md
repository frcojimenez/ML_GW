# Machine learning search with GW
We present here the results of the project dedicate to find Gravitational Wave events with Machine learning libraries.
The setup and results are presented as an educational tool. We encourage the users to individually optimize the code to reach further improved accuracy and efficiency. The results of the notebook 'ml_search' were obtained in the G2net 4th training school in Thessaloniki (https://indico.physics.auth.gr/event/14/#:~:text=The%20G2Net%20COST%20action%20is,ML)%20techniques%20is%20rapidly%20evolving.).
